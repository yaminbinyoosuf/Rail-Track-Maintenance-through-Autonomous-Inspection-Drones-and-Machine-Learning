1. Drone Programming 


# Assume you have a Drone class with methods for control and navigation
class Drone:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize drone connection and parameters

    def take_off(self, altitude):
        # Code for taking off to a specified altitude

    def perform_inspection_mission(self, waypoints):
        # Code for autonomously navigating the drone along the railway track

    def land(self):
        # Code for landing the drone

# Instantiate the drone
drone = Drone()

# Take off
drone.take_off(10)

# Perform inspection mission
waypoints = [(lat1, lon1), (lat2, lon2), ...]
drone.perform_inspection_mission(waypoints)

# Land the drone
drone.land()

2. Machine Learning

# Assume you have a MachineLearningModel class for anomaly detection
class MachineLearningModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the neural network model

    def build_model(self):
        # Code to define the neural network architecture

    def train_model(self, train_data, epochs):
        # Code to train the machine learning model

    def predict_anomalies(self, test_data):
        # Code to make predictions on test data

# Instantiate the machine learning model
ml_model = MachineLearningModel()

# Build and train the model
ml_model.build_model()
ml_model.train_model(train_data, epochs=10)

# Make predictions on test data
predictions = ml_model.predict_anomalies(test_data)

# Identify and process anomalies
# Implement logic to pinpoint areas requiring maintenance based on predictions


3. Integration and Communication

# Assume you have an Integration class for handling data integration
class Integration:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize communication and integration parameters

    def receive_data_from_drone(self, data):
        # Code to receive data from the drone

    def integrate_with_maintenance_system(self, anomaly_data):
        # Code to integrate anomaly data with existing maintenance systems

# Instantiate the integration component
integration = Integration()

# Receive data from the drone
drone_data = {...}  # Drone sensor data
integration.receive_data_from_drone(drone_data)

# Process and integrate data with maintenance systems
integration.integrate_with_maintenance_system(anomaly_data)
